The literator uses JavaScript to extract information from your favorite books. Facts such as most used or least used words. 
In addition, it allows for search functionality, allowing a user to search for a specific word, and to highlight its first instance, along with its frequency. 

To put it simply, I used objects(dictionary, map, ...) in javascript to count uncommon words in the book (skipping 'the', 'or' ...) to display 
some interesting stats. It goes without saying that it's not quite that simple.
