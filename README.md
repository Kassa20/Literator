The literator uses javascript to excract information from your favorite books. Facts such as most used or least used words. 
In addition, it allows for search functionallity, allowing a user to search for a specific word, and to highlight its first instance, along with its frequency. 

To put simply, I used objects(dictionary, map, ...) in javascript to count uncommon words in the book (skipping 'the', 'or' ...) to display 
some interesting stats. It goes without saying that its not quite that simple.
